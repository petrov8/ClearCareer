<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This app is a condensed version of a recruitment platform, and it features job-seekers, recruiters or administrators. 
Registered and authenticated users can upgrade their profile information and change their profile pictures. 
Job-seekers can view job postings and apply for them, whereas recruiters can publish/edit/delete new job offers. 
Additional checks ensure recruiters can only interact with their own posts. 
Job-seekers and recruiters can view all offers associated to their accounts via a ‘private’ catalogue page. 
Administrators oversee the entire process and can edit or delete job
offers, as well as apply the same actions to other users’ profiles. To ensure maximum storage capacity,
pictures (profile or job-offers) are resized via an external service prior to being stored in the cloud.
Furthermore, the back-end automatically differentiates between profile and job offer photos, and
applies different resizing. The app features authorization and authentication checks, as well as global
handlers for processing and displaying error messages or loading spinners. The back-end is fully unit-tested
with ‘mocks’ used to test 3rd party services.

    - Can access job listings with no further details.

    "Job Seeker" (logged in):
    - Can access job listings and additional details.
    - Can update profile information.

    "Recruiter" (logged in):
    - Can access job listings and additional details.
    - Can update profile information.
    - Can publish new jobs.

    "Administrator" (logged in):
    - Can access job listings and additional details.
    - Can update profile information.
    - Can edit any job listing.
    - Can delete any job listing.


Functionalities:

    "Dashboard": 
    - Shows all basic info for available job postings.

    "Details": 
    - Shows further details about a specific job posting. 

    "My-profile": 
    - Shows personal details of logged-in users. 
    - Profiles can be edited by their owners or by admins.
    - In case user hasn't uploaded a profile picture, a default one will be rendered. 

    "Edit Job":

    "Delete": 
    - Allows recruiters to delete their own job postings.

Features:

    - Image uploads are first converted to base64 format and then then passed by the service side onto an external image resizing API.
    - Different resizing profiles are applied to different use-cases (profile or job image upload)
    - Once the image has been succesfully resized it is then uploaded and stored onto a remote cloud service.
    - A corresponding URL is stored in the database and passed onto the "Client" upon request. 
    - This process helps reduce strain on the server side, standardize image sizing and reduce storage requirements.
